# A walk through to explain the use of GIT

The exercise in this project comes from [MDN Challenge: Styling a biography](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Styling_a_bio_page)

This repository contains:

1. The instructions for a simple CSS exercise
1. The starter code
1. The solution code

Trainees will follow a walk through to **fork** this repository, **clone** the copy down to their own computer, **complete the CSS exercise**, use **git commands** to `add`, `commit`, and `push` changes, finally create a **pull request** to submit their work.
